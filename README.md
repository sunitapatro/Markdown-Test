title: Timeouts And Reflections
---

I love [coffee][]. I really do. And yet I haven't had any for 4 days now. The first day was rough, I got the headaches that everybody will tell you about when it comes to the topic of caffeine withdrawal symptoms. The second day was better and by the third, the headaches were gone. And I'm just halfway done.






I'm not gonna drink coffee for a couple more days. It's part of a yearly
ritual I have of not drinking any coffee for at least a week or so. Last year
the headaches didn't disappear until day 5 so I decided to go for 10 days
without coffee instead of 7. And after the headaches disappear, the fun part
starts: trying to figure out how to replace something so integral of my life.
What to drink for breakfast now? What to do instead of going to the coffee
shop?

So why is this important? Everybody does not drink coffee at some point,
right? It's important because it's part of something I've tried to
continuously include more and more in my life over the years. Taking timeouts
and making time for reflections. Humans tend to be creatures of habit. If you
want to achieve something that needs constant work, build a habit out of it.
You want to read more books? Spend 30 minutes every morning with just reading.
You want to lose weight? Have a strict habit of going to the gym every Monday,
